# Reinforcement Learning Techniques
## Markov Desicion Proccess (MDP)
Use of an MDP structure and the Value Iteration Algorithm to solve the Gridworld board problem
## Q-Learning
Use of Q-Learning and Value Iteration Algorithms to solve the Gridworld board problem
## Deep Q Network
Implemented 4 different cases
* Conventional Deep Q Network
* Deep Q Network with Experience replay and Target Netwrok
* Deep Q Network with Target Netwrok
* Deep Q Network with Experience replay and Target Netwrok (best accuracy level)
