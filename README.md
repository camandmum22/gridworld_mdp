# Gridworld & CartPole Solver
This project implements and compares diffeernt Reinforcement Learning approaches to solve the Gridworld and CartPole problems.
## Markov Desicion Proccess (MDP)
Use of an MDP structure + Value Iteration Algorithm to solve the Gridworld board problem
## Q-Learning
Use of Q-Learning + Value Iteration Algorithm to solve the Gridworld board problem
## Deep Q Network
Implemented 4 different cases to solve the CartPole problem
* Conventional Deep Q Network
* Deep Q Network with Experience replay and Target Netwrok
* Deep Q Network with Target Netwrok
* Deep Q Network with Experience replay and Target Netwrok (best accuracy level)
